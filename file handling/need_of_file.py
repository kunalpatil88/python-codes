Need of File
============
Value or data stored in variable is always temporary.
It remains in the variable so long as the program is running.
The moment program ends, memory of that variable is released
and value stored in the variable is lost.

If there is need to store data permanently which is received
in the variable, there is need of file.

Files are used to store data permanently that can be retreived
afterward.
